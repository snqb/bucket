# 🪣 bucket

Hi. This is bucket, a to-do app. Yup, I've built a **to-do app** :/

_in 2022_

(because most to-do lists are like strict and demanding parents who try to look cool 🤡)

### why?

my only "user" besides me is my friend Zhanik, here's his review:
> on evenings I like putting progress into tasks I worked on during the day, feels so gooood

so, I've tried to make something different, something more humane:

- 🧀 no ~~checkboxes~~, few things in life are done in one big stroke of will, but you need progress. In bucket you have progress(arbitrary, it's no Jira)

- 🪄 it generates(poorly) emojis for tasks, because it's _fun_ (imo they also improve readability)
- ⏲️ no deadlines, no notifications -- screw those
- 🪣 it's just a bucket, dead-simple

### how do I get it?
It's a PWA, the link is in the description. Just add it to your desktop. It doesn't sync data with anything, just stores everything locally.

it's not very ready yet, the code's meh and I am still breaking things, so use with caution

even this readme was written just so this repo looks OK because I've sent it to potential employyes 🤐
